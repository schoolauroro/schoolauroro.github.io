<h2>About</h2>
<p>A small litle project I'm doing for no reason what so ever. I'm not a good coder so, everything is super basic HTML.</p>
<h2>When?</h2>
<p>January 19, 2024 was when this website was actually made :D</p>

<h2>Seeing This Site In School?</h2>
<h3>Students</h3>
<p>Please access this website carefully. This could get you in some trouble! Especially if you're accessing games hosted and/or linked here!</p>
<h3>Staff (Teachers, IT, etc.)</h3>
<p>If you're looking at his as a staff member, you probably got here by checking a student's laptop or seeing this website in the dns records. I've made this website only for fun for me and my CLOSE friends. It's not like it's gonna spread.</p>
