<h2>Old Websites</h2> 
<p>I was super inspired by the super old websites listed down below!</p>
<li><a href="https://milk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://spork.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spork</a></li>

<h2>Other Websites</h2>
<h3>GoDaddy (Don't laugh at it!)</h3>
<p>GoDaddy showed me that I HATE it and web design websites like it because it doesn't let you customize the code itself, so I'll do it myself.</p>
<h3>Google Sites</h3>
<p>Google Sites was really nice to show information off, but extremely hard to customize.</p>
<h3>Nextcloud</h3>
<p>Nextcloud is a self hosting cloud service if you didn't know. I loved it when I hosted it myself, but it was to hard to maintain. I archived it on Internet Archive if you want to see.</p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230517233019/https://dogecloud.ddns.net/index.php/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nextcloud Website I Had</a>
<h3>Internet Archive</h3>
<p>That reminds me! Internet Archive's Wayback Machine helped me and others preserve and relive the nostalgia of the internet! Go and take a look!</p>

<h3>FNF Go</h3>
<p>FNF Go is website for running Friday Night Funkin in you're browser, it helped inspire me to put in the Snake Game on to my website.</p>

<h2>Teachers</h2>  
<h3>Mrs. Dunleavy</h3>
<p>In the 7th grade at Paxon Hollow Middle School. Mrs. Dunleavy taught us how to code HTML. Most people thought it was useless, but I didn't, now we're here today.</p>
