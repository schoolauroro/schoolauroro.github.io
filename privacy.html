<h2>Tracking (on this site)</h2>
<p>I do no tracking myself. I use Github Pages so, go read their terms and stuff. "Minecraft" is also hosted here. It came from EaglerCraft and I'm 80% sure it's not malicious. It will, however, save cookies. Go to terms to learn more.</p>
<h2>Tracking (outside links)</h2>
<p>When you click on links that direct you to external websites not hosted on Doge Cloud. Your data could be tracked and sold. This is out of my control and I'm not responsible for this.</p>
