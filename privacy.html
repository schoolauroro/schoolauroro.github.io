<p>I don't use custom cookies or track your IP adress or whatever. (Google AdSense might, more below)</p>
<h2>Google AdSense</h2>
<p>Google AdSense provides the ads on this website. It's obviously a 3rd party that I can't control. I set the settings to the most privacy friendly to prevent tracking. I can't guarantee that Google AdSesnse won't track you!</p>
