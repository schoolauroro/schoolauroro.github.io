<h1>Terms</h1>

<h2>Tracking On And Off Site</h2>
<p>I do no tracking myself (scripts on the site). I use Github Pages so, go read their terms and stuff. "Minecraft" is also hosted here. It came from EaglerCraft and I'm 80% sure it's not malicious. It will, however, save "site data". Going oustide of this website, including clicking links that direct you to other websites, will cause any terms here to lose power. This means that any tracking outside this website is out of my control. I suggest you use a browser other than Chrome, disable 3rd party cookies, and install an adblocker, like uBlock Origin.</p>
<h2>Cloudflare</h2>
<p>"Web Analytics (formerly known as Browser Insights) provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website. Web Analytics does not collect your visitor's personal data, and allows you to have a detailed view into the performance of web pages as experienced by your visitors."</p>
<h2>Github (Pages)</h2>
<p>This website is on Github Pages. Github does what Github wants. Go read their terms and conditions or whatever.</p>
<h2>EaglerCraft</h2>
<p>I've hosted an instance of "EaglerCraft" for CASUAL and EDUCATIONAL purposes. I'm not associated with EaglerCraft, Mojang, or Microsoft. This was added for the soul purpose of making this website for me and my friends!</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>When clicking links on this website that redirect you to websites outside of Doge Cloud. You must be aware that you are subject to their terms and conditions.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies? What are those?</p>
