<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>There are ads, wow. I put at most, 1 ad per page. I might not put any at all for some pages for convience of the viewer. (More about it down below in Google AdSense) If you have an adblocker, I don't really care.</p>
<h2>Tracking</h2>
<p>I try to minimalize tracking from Google. (More about it down below in Google AdSense) I don't personally track you for my own benifit (on the website with cookies and such.)</p>
<h2>Github (Pages)</h2>
<p>This website is on Github Pages. Github does what Github wants.</p>
<h2>Google (AdSense)</h2>
<p>I use Google AdSense. They may do whatever with the ads. I try my best to limit tracking and amount of ads. I have no guarantee that Google won't track you. I will talk more about it on the Privacy Page.</p>
